# Web_Scraper_Llama3
This is a web scraper to extract data from a website, with the help of **Llama3** model. To run it locally, please install the **Ollama** and pull the model.

The following libraries are necessary: 
* Selenium
* Beautifulsoup
* Langchain
* Langchain_ollama

In addition, users have to download a chrome webdriver from [https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/). 

Finally, we can launch the main program by **streamlit**: 
```
streamlit run main.py
```
